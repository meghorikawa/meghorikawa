# 👋 Hi, I’m Megan (@meghorikawa)

- 🌐 Multilingual: 🇺🇸 English (native) | 🇯🇵 Japanese (C1/C2) | 🇩🇪 German (B1)  
- 🎓 Computational Linguistics (M.A.) | NLP & Data Science (expected 9/2025) 
- 💡 Research Areas of interest:  
  - Linguistic Complexity
  - ICALL (Intelligent Computer-Assisted Language Learning)  
  - Text Classification (sentiment, affect, learner error analysis)  
  - Affordances & applications of Large Language Models  
  - Educational Technology & Task-Based Learning  

## 📖 Master's Thesis
**Modeling L2 Japanese Proficiency with Linguistic Complexity Measures and Criterial Features**  
- Investigated how linguistic complexity measures and criterial features can model Japanese as a Second Language (L2) proficiency using the **I-JAS corpus**.  
- Applied an **Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)** for interpretable classification
  
## 🔭 Projects
- **KReLax: Multilingual Emotion Detection(SemEval-2025)**  
  Co-authored a published paper proposing an ensemble-based approach to multilingual emotion detection and addressing data imbalance.
    [ACL Anthology (2025)](https://aclanthology.org/2025.semeval-1.113/)
- **ARES (AI-Assisted Extension for Grammar Exercises)**  
  Enhancing grammar learning with AI-driven feedback aligned with pedagogical principles.
- **LLM Evaluation for Task-Based Language Learning Chatbots**  
  Analyzed the integration of LLMs into a rule-based chatbot to support smoother learner interactions.
- **Lingustic benchmark performance: Testing Effects of Reinforcement Learning**  
  Explored how reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLHF) shifts LLM performance on syntax, semantics, and pragmatics benchmarks compared to base models.
